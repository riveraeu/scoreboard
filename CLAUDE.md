# Scoreboard — Project Guide for Claude

## What This Is
A sports prop betting dashboard that pulls Kalshi prediction market prices, computes a model True%, and shows qualified plays with an edge over the market. Deployed on Vercel Edge (no Node.js APIs — Web Fetch/KV only).

**Production URL**: `https://scoreboard-ivory-xi.vercel.app`

## Architecture

### API: `api/[...path].js` + `api/lib/`
`api/[...path].js` handles all server logic as a Vercel Edge Function. It imports from four ES module lib files:
- `api/lib/simulate.js` — park factor constants + all simulation functions (log5K, simulateKsDist, buildNbaStatDist, simulateHits, kelly/EV math)
- `api/lib/mlb.js` — MLB data fetchers (buildLineupKPct, buildBarrelPct, buildPitcherKPct) + MLB_ID_TO_ABBR
- `api/lib/nba.js` — NBA/DVP data fetchers (buildNbaDvpStage1/FromBettingPros/Stage3FG, buildNbaDepthChartPos, buildNbaPaceData, buildNbaPlayerPosFromSleeper, warmPlayerInfoCache)
- `api/lib/utils.js` — response helpers (corsHeaders, jsonResponse, errorResponse), ALLOWED_ORIGIN, team ranking helpers (buildSoftTeamAbbrs, buildHardTeamAbbrs, buildTeamRankMap, parseGameOdds, SOFT_TEAM_METRIC)

Routes via `pathname`:
- `/api/tonight` — main play generation endpoint
- `/api/tonight?debug=1` — returns all markets including dropped/preDropped + debug fields
- `/api/tonight?bust=1` — bypasses KV cache
- `/api/kalshi` — raw Kalshi market data
- `/api/player` — ESPN player info + gamelog
- `/api/dvp` — Defense vs Position data
- `/api/nba-depth` — NBA depth chart from ESPN
- `/api/keepalive` — cron ping (daily)
- `/api/dvp/debug-dc` — inspect depth chart cache

### Frontend: `index.html`
Single HTML file with JSX compiled via Babel standalone (no build step). All React components inline.

### Storage: Cloudflare KV (`CACHE2`)
Used for caching expensive fetches. Key TTLs:
- `byteam:mlb` — 600s (MLB team stats, probables, lineup K-rates). **Does NOT include `barrelPctMap`** — that lives in `mlb:barrelPct`. Uses 60s TTL if lineupSpotByName or pitcherAvgPitches come back empty (e.g. bust before lineups confirmed), so next request retries quickly.
- `byteam:nba` — 1800s (defensive stats)
- `byteam:nba:scoring` — 21600s (6h, NBA team offensive PPG; used for total simulation)
- `byteam:nfl` — 1800s
- `byteam:nhl` — 21600s (6h, NHL team stats: goalsAgainstPerGame + shotsAgainstPerGame)
- `gameTimes:v2:{date}` — 600s
- `nbaStatus:{date}` — 600s
- `nba:pace:2526` — 43200s (12h, fetched via ESPN `sports.core.api.espn.com` team stats, `buildNbaPaceData()`)
- `mlb:barrelPct` — 21600s (6h, Baseball Savant barrel%)
- `nba:depth:{date}` — daily

## Sports & Stats

### Game Totals (all sports)
- **Stat**: `totalRuns` (MLB), `totalPoints` (NBA), `totalGoals` (NHL), `totalPoints` (NFL)
- **Kalshi series**: `KXMLBTOTAL`, `KXNBATOTAL`, `KXNHLTOTAL`, `KXNFLTOTAL` — each with `gameType: "total"` in SERIES_CONFIG
- **Market format**: `floor_strike = N` means "over N-0.5" (i.e., YES = total >= N); `pct` filter: 30–97% (wider than player props)
- **True%**: Monte Carlo simulation per sport — Poisson for MLB/NHL (`simulateMLBTotalDist`, `simulateNHLTotalDist`), Normal for NBA (`simulateNBATotalDist`)
- **Team extraction**: `parseGameTeams()` handles all sport-specific team code formats
- **`direction: "over"`** — currently only over plays surfaced (YES on Kalshi)
- **Edge gate**: `edge >= 3%` (same as player props); no soft matchup gate for totals
- **SimScore** (max 14): pitcher/team data availability (3+3+2+2pts) + park/context signals (2+2pts); `qualified: totalSimScore >= 7`
- **Data maps** (`mlbRPGMap`, `nhlGPGMap/GAAMap`, `nbaOffPPGMap`) computed inline after `leagueAvgCache` block
- **Play card**: `gameType: "total"` flag triggers `TotalPlayCard` branch in the play card render; shows dual team logos (ESPN CDN), matchup header, true%/Kalshi% bars, stats row
- **Track ID format**: `total|sport|homeTeam|awayTeam|threshold|gameDate`

#### Total SimScore details
- **MLB**: homeERA known→3pts, awayERA known→3pts, homeRPG→2pts, awayRPG→2pts, |parkRF-1|>0.01→2pts, maxERA>4.5→2pts (max 14)
- **NBA**: homeOff PPG→3pts, awayOff PPG→3pts, homeDefPPG→2pts, awayDefPPG→2pts, both pace known→2pts, avg pace above league→2pts (max 14)
- **NHL**: homeGPG→3pts, awayGPG→3pts, homeGAA→2pts, awayGAA→2pts, home SA rank→2pts, away SA rank→2pts (max 14)

#### Lambda computation (MLB)
`homeLambda = homeRPG × (awayERA / 4.20) × parkRF`, clamped [1, 12]
`awayLambda = awayRPG × (homeERA / 4.20) × parkRF`, clamped [1, 12]

#### Lambda computation (NHL)
`homeLambda = homeGPG × (awayGAA / leagueAvgGAA)`, clamped [0.5, 8]
`awayLambda = awayGPG × (homeGAA / leagueAvgGAA)`, clamped [0.5, 8]

#### Mean computation (NBA)
`homeExpected = homeOffPPG × (awayDefPPG / leagueAvgDef)`
`awayExpected = awayOffPPG × (homeDefPPG / leagueAvgDef)`

### MLB
- **Stats**: `hits`, `hrr` (H+R+RBI), `strikeouts`
- **Kalshi series**: `KXMLBHITS`, `KXMLBHRR`, `KXMLBKS`
- **Data sources**: MLB Stats API (schedule, lineups, probables, pitcher gamelogs), ESPN gamelogs, Baseball Savant (barrel%)

#### MLB Strikeouts Model
True% = Monte Carlo simulation (`simulateKsDist` + `kDistPct`)
- Shared distribution per pitcher (keyed `playerTeam|pitcherHand`) — guarantees P(K≥4) ≥ P(K≥5)
- `pitcherKDistCache` built before play loop
- 10000 sims if `simScore ≥ 11`, else 5000
- **SimScore** (max 14, no edge bonus — edge gates separately):
  - CSW%/K% tiered (1/2/3pts): CSW% > 30% = 3pts (green), CSW% > 26% to ≤ 30% = 2pts (yellow), CSW% ≤ 26% = 1pt (red). Falls back to regressed K% only if CSW% is unavailable (null): K% > 27% = 3pts, K% > 24% to ≤ 27% = 2pts, K% ≤ 24% = 1pt. Null CSW% + null K% = 1pt (abstain). (The gs26 < 4 small-sample guard was removed — CSW% is always used when present, regardless of gs26.) Stored as `kpctPts` (1/2/3); `kpctMeets = kpctPts > 0` (boolean, always true now).
  - K-BB% > 15% → 2pts
  - Lineup oK% tiered (`lkpPts`): > 24% → 3pts (green), > 16% → 2pt (yellow, avg/below-avg lineup), ≤ 16% → 0pts; null → 1pt (abstain, like ML/total). `lkpMeets = lkpPts > 0`. Hand-adjusted vs RHP/LHP.
  - Avg pitches/start > 85 → 2pts (uses 2026 data only if gs26 ≥ 4; else falls back to 2025)
  - ML tier (`mlPts`): ≤ -130 → 2pts, -129 to -101 → 1pt, ≥ -100 → 0pts; null → 1pt
  - O/U tier (`totalPts`): ≤ 8.5 → 2pts (low total = pitcher dominant), 8.5–10.5 → 1pt, >10.5 → 0pts; null → 1pt
  - Edge ≥ 3% required (gates play independently, not part of SimScore)
- `parkMeets` (`PARK_KFACTOR[homeTeam] > 1.0`) is still computed and included in debug output but no longer contributes to SimScore — park factor is applied inside `simulateKsDist` and affects truePct directly. `PARK_KFACTOR` values updated from FanGraphs 2024 SO column (multi-year rolling avg).
- `kpctPts`: 1/2/3 — CSW%/K% tier score. 3=green (CSW%>30% or K%>27%), 2=yellow (CSW% 26-30% or K% 24-27%), 1=red (≤26% CSW or ≤24% K, or null). Drives badge color and value in explanation cards.
- `mlPts`: 0/1/2 — ML tier score. Color in UI: 2=green, 1=yellow, 0=red. Also drives ML column color in market report (≤-130 green, -129 to -101 yellow, ≥-100 red).
- `totalPts`: 0/1/2 — O/U tier score. Color in UI: 2=green, 1=yellow, 0=red. Drives O/U column color in market report (≤8.5 green, 8.5–10.5 yellow, >10.5 red). Low total = pitcher dominant = favorable for Ks.
- `pitcherGS26`: 2026 games started per team abbr, exported from `buildPitcherKPct`, used for small-sample guards. Included in `plays[]` output for debugging (alongside `pitcherHasAnchor`).
- **Gates**: simScore ≥ 7 to enter play loop; finalSimScore ≥ 11 to qualify as a play (7–10 = qualified:false, shows in report but not plays card); insufficient_starts gate: if `hasAnchor !== true` (no reliable 2025 anchor, or null if not in data) requires `gs26 ≥ 8` (null gs26 treated as 0); if `hasAnchor === true` passes through regardless of gs26 — the 2025 anchor IS the reliability signal. Catches TJ-return / pure-reliever pitchers who have a few 2026 starts but no valid 2025 baseline (e.g. Detmers with 0 2025 GS — needs 8 starts before model trusts). **Important**: insufficient_starts is checked in BOTH the pre-filter loop AND the main play loop (because `?debug=1` bypasses the pre-filter and uses `qualifyingMarkets` directly). Main loop gate at `api/[...path].js` ~line 1713 uses corrected `playerTeam`; in debug mode pushes to `dropped[]` with reason `"insufficient_starts"` so they appear in the report but not in `plays[]`.
- `pitcherHasAnchor`: `true` if gs25 ≥ 5 AND bf25 ≥ 100 (reliable 2025 *starter* anchor). Included in `plays[]` output for debugging. A reliever-turned-starter has bf25 > 0 but gs25 = 0 — reliever K% is not a valid anchor. bf25 ≥ 100 also excludes injury-shortened seasons (e.g. TJ recovery with 5 starts but minimal workload).
- Pitchers fetched via `buildPitcherKPct(mlbSched)` — avg pitches per start from 2026 gamelog (starts-only filtered via `gamesStarted > 0`); falls back to 2025 season aggregate `numberOfPitches / gamesStarted` when no 2026 start data in gamelog
- **K% regression**: `trust = min(1.0, bf26 / 200)` — uses 2026 BF only (NOT combined 2026+2025). Full trust at ~33 starts. Blends 2026 actual K% with 2025 anchor (or league avg 22.2% if no 2025 data). KBB% regressed the same way.

#### MLB Hitters (hits/hrr) Model
- **`hits` True%**: Monte Carlo simulation (`simulateHits`) using batter BA × pitcher BAA (log5), park-adjusted
- **`hrr` True%**: `(primaryPct + softPct) / 2 × parkFactor` (no Monte Carlo)
  - `primaryPct` = player's 2026 HRR 1+ rate (falls back to 2025+2026 blend, then career)
  - `softPct` = HRR 1+ rate vs tonight's pitcher (H2H gamelog dates) or vs tonight's team (2025+2026 fallback)
  - BA is NOT directly in the formula — it's implicit via the player's historical HRR rate
- **SimScore** (max 14, edge gates separately — same pattern as strikeouts):
  - Lineup spot 1–3 → 3pts, spot 4 → 2pts
  - Pitcher WHIP > 1.35 → 3pts (from pitcher gamelog)
  - Pitcher FIP > ERA → 2pts
  - Park hit factor > 1.02 → 1pt
  - Barrel% tier: ≥14% → 3pts, ≥10% → 2pts, ≥7% → 1pt, <7% → 0pts, null → 1pt (abstain)
  - O/U total tier (high total = more run-scoring): ≥9.5 → 2pts, ≥7.5 → 1pt, <7.5 → 0pts, null → 1pt
  - Max: 3+3+2+1+3+2 = 14
- **Gates**: lineup spot 1–4 required; hitterSimScore ≥ 7; edge ≥ 3% (gate only, not scored)
- Barrel% from Baseball Savant (`buildBarrelPct`) — cached 6h in KV; `hitterBarrelPts` stored in play output
- NBA game totals fetched from ESPN scoreboard (`sportByteam.nbaGameOdds`) — always fresh (not long-term cached)

### NBA
- **Stats**: `points`, `rebounds`, `assists`, `threePointers`
- **Kalshi series**: various per stat
- True% = Monte Carlo simulation (`buildNbaStatDist` + `nbaDistPct`) — normal distribution over per-game values
  - `nbaPlayerDistCache` keyed `playerId|stat` — all thresholds (3+, 4+, 5+) share one distribution, guaranteeing monotonicity
  - Mean from last 10 games (recency), std from full season (stability)
  - Adjusted mean: `× teamDefFactor × (1 + paceAdj×0.002) × 0.93 if B2B`
  - `teamDefFactor` = general team defense (`rankMap[opp].value / leagueAvg`) — NOT position-adjusted DVP
  - Falls back to avg(seasonPct, softPct) − 4% if B2B when simulation returns null (<5 game values)
- **SimScore** (max 14, edge gates separately — same pattern as MLB strikeouts):
  - Pace (avg game pace above league avg) → 3pts — fetched from ESPN via `buildNbaPaceData()`, cached 12h
  - Avg minutes ≥ 30 (last 10 games) → 4pts; ≥ 25 → 2pts
  - Position-adjusted DVP rank ≤ 10 → 2pts
  - Not B2B → 2pts
  - Game total tier: ≥235 → 3pts, ≥225 → 2pts, ≥215 → 1pt, <215 → 0pts, null → 1pt (abstain)
  - Max: 3+4+2+2+3 = 14
  - Game totals from `sportByteam.nbaGameOdds` (ESPN NBA scoreboard, fetched fresh each request alongside byteam stats)
- nSim scales with pre-edge simScore: ≥8 → 10k, ≥5 → 5k, else 2k
- **Gate**: opp in soft DVP teams; edge ≥ 3% (gate only, not scored)
- Avg minutes from ESPN gamelog `MIN` column (last 10 games), no external API needed
- Depth chart position via `nbaDepthChartPos` (ESPN depth chart API, cached daily)

### NHL
- **Stats**: `points` only (goals/assists removed)
- **Kalshi series**: `KXNHLPTS`
- **Data sources**: NHL Stats API (GAA, shots against per team), ESPN gamelogs (points, TOI)

#### NHL Points Model
True% = Monte Carlo simulation (reuses `buildNbaStatDist` + `nbaDistPct`) — normal distribution over per-game point values
- `nhlPlayerDistCache` keyed `playerId|stat` — all thresholds share one distribution, guaranteeing monotonicity
- Mean from recent game values, adjusted: `× teamDefFactor × (1 + shotsAdj×0.002) × 0.93 if B2B`
- `teamDefFactor` = opp GAA / league avg GAA
- Falls back to dvp-adjusted average formula if simulation returns null
- **SimScore** (max 11 pre-edge, 14 with edge bonus):
  - Shots against adj (opp SA vs league avg > 0) → 3pts
  - Avg TOI ≥ 18 min (last 10 games) → 4pts; ≥ 15 min → 2pts
  - Opponent GAA rank ≤ 10 → 2pts
  - Not B2B → 2pts
  - Edge ≥ 3% → 3pts (bonus, added after simulation)
- nSim scales with pre-edge simScore: ≥8 → 10k, ≥5 → 5k, else 2k
- **B2B** detection: same as NBA — checks if last gamelog event was yesterday (UTC)
- TOI from ESPN gamelog `TOI` or `timeOnIce` column; parsed as `MM:SS` or decimal minutes
- Shots against rank from NHL API `shotsAgainstPerGame`, stored in `nhlSaRankMap`, league avg in `nhlLeagueAvgSa`
- **Gate**: edge ≥ 3% (no backend soft team gate — all NHL markets enter play loop)

### NFL
- **Stats**: `passingYards`, `rushingYards`, `receivingYards`, `receptions`, `completions`, `attempts`
- Gate: opp in soft teams; edge ≥ 3%

### `api/[...path].js` — Route Handlers & Play Loop

| `STAT_SOFT` | ~1176 | Soft/rank data per `sport|stat`, built from byteam data |

### Kalshi Market Parsing
- Series tickers in `SERIES_CONFIG`
- Filter: `pct >= 70` AND `pct <= 97`
- Blended fill price via orderbook walk for thin markets
- `kalshiSpread` = bid-ask spread in cents (`round((yesAsk − yesBid) × 100)`)
- `spreadAdj = kalshiSpread / 2` — half-spread deducted from raw edge to get `edge` (net)
- `rawEdge = truePct − kalshiPct`; `edge = rawEdge − spreadAdj` — all gates and simScore bonuses use net edge
- `lowVolume = kalshiVolume < 20` — shown as badge on play card; volume and spread improve as game approaches

### preDropped vs dropped
- `preDropped`: filtered before main play loop (no ESPN info yet) — included in `?debug=1` response
- `dropped`: filtered inside play loop — included in `?debug=1` response

### qualified:false plays
MLB strikeout markets that fail simScore gate (< 7 or finalSimScore < 11) are pushed to `plays[]` with `qualified: false` so the player card can show real simPct for all thresholds. The main plays list (`tonightPlays`) filters these out client-side: `.filter(p => p.qualified !== false)`.

The raw (unfiltered) array is stored in `allTonightPlays` and used to build `tonightPlayerMap` in the player card — this ensures `qualified: false` thresholds (e.g. 3+/4+ strikeouts with no edge bonus) get their simulation-based truePct rather than falling back to the raw formula.

### bestMap deduplication — which threshold shows in plays card
`bestMap` dedupes to one play per `playerName|sport|stat` for qualified plays. The winner is the play with the **lowest threshold** (`play.threshold < prev.threshold`) — most achievable outcome, highest truePct. Non-qualifying (`qualified: false`) plays use a threshold-inclusive key and don't compete. After bestMap, non-winning qualified thresholds are re-added as `qualified: false` for the player card.

---

## Frontend Architecture (`index.html`)

### State
- `tonightPlays` — qualified plays from `/api/tonight`, filtered `qualified !== false`
- `allTonightPlays` — raw (unfiltered) plays array from `/api/tonight`, includes `qualified: false` entries; used exclusively for building `tonightPlayerMap` in the player card so all strikeout thresholds get their simulation-based truePct instead of falling back to the raw formula
- `reportData` — full debug response from `/api/tonight?debug=1`, shown in Market Report overlay
- `player` — currently selected player for detail card
- `trackedPlays` — user's saved picks (localStorage or server)

### Market Report
Opened via "report" button. Shows ALL markets (plays + dropped) grouped by sport/stat. Columns vary by sport/stat via `XCOLS` map.
- **`fetchReport` syncs plays card**: After fetching `?debug=1`, `fetchReport` also updates `tonightPlays` and `allTonightPlays` from the fresh response. This keeps the plays card in sync with the report (avoids stale-cache discrepancy where plays card loaded at page open shows different results than the report fetched later).
- **HRR table**: shows threshold=1 rows only (2+/3+/etc. filtered client-side — too noisy)
- **Score > 10 highlight**: For MLB rows (strikeouts + HRR), the player name is white+bold only when `finalSimScore ?? hitterFinalSimScore > 10` (Alpha tier). Rows with score ≤ 10 get a dim gray name even if qualified. Non-MLB tables use the original `m.qualified` logic for name color.

### Toolbar
Right side: **bust** button (calls `?bust=1`, shows "busting…" while loading) + **mock** toggle + My Picks anchor.

### Play Cards
Shows `untrackedPlays` (qualified plays not yet tracked). Each card has:
- True% bar (color = tierColor, odds = model-implied from truePct)
- Kalshi% bar (purple, odds = Kalshi americanOdds)
- Explanation card (varies by sport/stat)
- SimScore gate breakdown
- **Tier/unit row** — `tierUnits(americanOdds)`: ≤ -900 → 5u, ≤ -500 → 3u, else 1u. Stake = `bankroll × units / 100`.

### Player Card
Clicking a play opens the player card with:
- Historical rates per threshold
- Kalshi market prices
- truePct from `tonightPlayerMap` (keyed `stat|threshold`) — built from `allTonightPlays` (unfiltered) so `qualified: false` thresholds (e.g. 3+/4+ strikeouts with no edge bonus) use their simulation-based truePct
- Monotonicity enforced client-side: after building `_rawTruePctMap`, walks highest→lowest threshold tracking the running max and raises any value that dips below it. Safety net for any remaining non-monotonicity after backend sweep.
- **Per-game gamelog table** (bottom of card) — current season only, sortable columns with hover tooltips

#### Gamelog Table
Defined by `GAMELOG_COLS` constant (before `App()`), keyed by sport (`"baseball/mlb_pitcher"`, `"baseball/mlb_hitter"`, `"basketball/nba"`, `"hockey/nhl"`, `"football/nfl"`). Each column has `key`, `label`, `tooltip`, `align`. Sort state in `gamelogSort: { col, dir }`.

**Columns by sport (SimScore-relevant cols noted):**
- **MLB Pitcher**: Date, H/A, Opp, IP, H (hits allowed), ER, BB *(K-BB% gate)*, K *(CSW%/K% gate)*, PC *(avg pitches gate)*
- **MLB Hitter**: Date, H/A, Opp, AB, H, HR, R *(HRR component)*, RBI *(HRR component)*, BB, HRR *(combined Kalshi stat)*
- **NBA**: Date, H/A, Opp, PTS, REB, AST, 3P, MIN *(≥30=4pts, ≥25=2pts SimScore)*, Rest *(1=B2B gate)*
- **NHL**: Date, H/A, Opp, G, A, PTS, TOI *(≥18min=4pts, ≥15min=2pts SimScore)*, Rest *(1=B2B gate)*
- **NFL**: Date, H/A, Opp, CMP, ATT, PYds, RYds, REC, RecYds

**Data flow**: `parseGameLog` now threads `date`, `isHome`, `season` (derived from date year) into every `perGame` row. Additional stats extracted per sport: `er`/`pc` (pitcher), `ab`/`r`/`rbi`/`bb` (hitter), `min` (NBA), `g`/`a`/`toi` (NHL). `lvRaw` helper preserves TOI as a raw string (avoids `parseFloat("18:32")` = 18).

**Sort**: clicking a header toggles `desc→asc→desc`; new column resets to `desc`. Active sort shows `▲`/`▼`; inactive shows `⇅` (dim). TOI sorted by seconds (parses both `MM:SS` and decimal-minutes). Rest sorted numerically.

**Tooltips**: CSS-based — `.gl-th-wrap:hover .gl-tooltip { display: block }`. Tooltip is an absolutely-positioned `<span className="gl-tooltip">` inside `.gl-th-wrap`.

**Active stat column**: header turns `#58a6ff` and cells get `rgba(88,166,255,0.04)` bg. Mapped via `{ strikeouts→'strikeouts', hits→'hits', hrr→'hrr', points→'points', … }[safeTab]`.

**Rest = 1** (back-to-back) displayed in `#f78166` red as a visual B2B flag. Rest is computed without mutating `perGame` — uses a `restMap` (Map keyed to row object) built from date-ascending sort.

**Root cause of non-monotonic truePcts for strikeouts (fixed at backend):**
The deduplication step (`bestMap` keyed by `playerName|sport|stat`) collapsed all strikeout thresholds for a pitcher to the single highest-edge play (e.g. only 5+ survived). 3+ and 4+ were absent from `allTonightPlays`, so the player card used the fallback formula — giving values below the simulation's 5+ truePct, breaking monotonicity.

Fix: `qualified:false` plays use a threshold-inclusive key (`playerName|sport|stat|threshold`) so all thresholds survive deduplication. The post-loop monotonicity sweep then re-derives truePct for every threshold from the `pitcherKDistCache` distribution (if available), giving distinct monotonically-decreasing values (e.g. 3+≈99.5%, 4+≈99.0%, 5+=98.1%). Falls back to copy-up sweep if cache is unavailable.

### Explanation Cards (Play Card + Player Card)
Both play cards and player cards show an explanation block (`background:"#0d1117"`, `fontSize:11`, `lineHeight:1.65`) with two sections:
1. **Narrative prose** — why the play is recommended, key stats with qualitative context. Highlighted numbers use colored `<span>`; descriptive phrases (e.g. "a key starter") use `color:"#484f58"` (dim).
2. **SimScore row** — `SimScore` label + `X/14 Tier` badge + stat checkboxes. All on one flex line (`display:"flex", alignItems:"center", gap:6`). Badge uses `whiteSpace:"nowrap"`. Checkboxes in an inner `display:"inline-flex", gap:4, flexWrap:"wrap"` span so whole items wrap as units.

**SimScore checkbox helpers:**
- MLB: `mk(meets, pts, label)` → `✓/✗ label(pts)` — no spaces around checkmark
- NBA: `mkGate(meets, pts, label)` → `✓/✗ label (pts)` — spaces, `whiteSpace:"nowrap"` per item

**Edge gate color (all sports):**
- `≥ 3%` → `#3fb950` green, ✓, opacity 1
- `0–2.9%` → `#e3b341` yellow, ✗, opacity 0.7
- negative → `#f78166` red, ✗, opacity 0.7

**Player card explanation** uses the same structure. Data sources by sport:
- MLB strikeouts: `h2h` object built from `tonightPlayerMap` (includes `edge`, `kpctMeets`, `kpctPts`, `kbbMeets`, `lkpMeets`, `pitchesMeets`, `mlPts`, `parkMeets`)
- MLB hitters: `tonightHitPlay = Object.values(tonightPlayerMap).find(p => p.stat === safeTab)` (includes `hitterBa`, `hitterLineupSpot`, `pitcherWHIP`, `pitcherFIP`, `hitterWhipMeets`, `hitterFipMeets`, `hitterParkMeets`, `edge`)
- NBA: `tonightTabPlay` (includes `nbaOpportunity`, `nbaPaceAdj`, `isB2B`, `nbaSimScore`, `posDvpRank`, `posDvpValue`, `softPct`, `seasonPct`, `edge`)

### Color Tiers
```
tierColor(pct): >= 80% → #3fb950 (green), >= 65% → #e3b341 (yellow), else #f78166 (red)
```

### NBA AvgMin Tiers (report column)
- ≥ 30 min → green (4 SimScore pts)
- ≥ 25 min → yellow (2 SimScore pts)
- < 25 min → red (0 pts)

## Deployment
- Platform: Vercel Edge Functions
- No build step — `index.html` served statically, `api/[...path].js` is the edge function
- Rewrites in `vercel.json`: `/api/:path*` → `/api/[...path]`
- CORS headers set in `vercel.json` (required for OPTIONS preflight through rewrite layer)
- Cron: `/api/keepalive` runs daily at noon UTC
- **Deploy**: `git push origin main` — Vercel auto-deploys on push. No `vercel` CLI installed.

## Testing

Unit tests cover simulation math and the player card truePct fix:
```
# Preferred — no Node required, uses macOS built-in JavaScriptCore:
osascript -l JavaScript api/lib/simulate.test.jxa.js

# If Node is installed:
node --test api/lib/simulate.test.js
```
Two test files kept in sync:
- `api/lib/simulate.test.jxa.js` — self-contained, runs via `osascript -l JavaScript` (no Node needed). Primary test runner.
- `api/lib/simulate.test.js` — Node `node:test` version (requires Node).

Both cover: `kDistPct` monotonicity, `simulateKsDist` validity, `buildNbaStatDist`, API monotonicity sweep, `allTonightPlays` player card fix, frontend `_rawTruePctMap` monotonicity enforcement, NBA simScore, and report filter logic.

## Common Debugging

### "Why is truePct wrong for 3+/4+ when 5+ looks correct?" (fixed)
Previously, `tonightPlayerMap` was built from `tonightPlays` (filtered: `qualified !== false`). Thresholds like 3+/4+ with no edge bonus (finalSimScore < 11) were `qualified: false` and omitted, so the player card used the raw fallback formula `(seasonPct + softPct) / 2` — breaking monotonicity (e.g. 4+ showed 76.8% while 5+ showed 97.9%).

**Fix**: `tonightPlayerMap` now uses `allTonightPlays` (unfiltered), which includes `qualified: false` entries with their API-computed, monotonicity-enforced simulation truePct.

If truePct still looks wrong: check `?debug=1` and look in `dropped` for the missing threshold — if it's there (not in `plays[]` at all), the fallback still applies. Check `reason`.

### "Why is truePct the same for 4+ and 5+?"
The `pitcherKDistCache` shares one `Int16Array` distribution across all thresholds for a pitcher — querying it at different thresholds guarantees P(K≥4) ≥ P(K≥5) by construction. If values are identical, it likely means the distribution is flat at that range (e.g. a dominant pitcher where nearly all sims exceed both thresholds).

### "Player appears in Kalshi but not in plays or dropped"
Check `preDropped` in `?debug=1` response. Common reasons: `no_soft_data`, `opp_not_soft`, `no_opp`, `insufficient_starts` (MLB strikeouts only).

Also check the date filter: the edge function runs UTC, so after midnight UTC (e.g. 8pm ET = midnight UTC), `gameDate:"2026-04-13"` is filtered if the server sees the next day. The cutoff is `Date.now() - 86400000` (yesterday) to handle this — but if a play was on a date 2+ days ago, it will still be filtered.

### "Market report shows — for Spot/Brrl%"
- Spot: lineup not confirmed yet (pre-game). Projected lineups from last 14 days are used as fallback. The spot map scans ALL games in the window most-recent-first and takes each player's most recent batting position — so if a player DNP'ed yesterday their prior-game spot is preserved. The primary lineup IDs (for K% stat fetching) still come from the single most recent game that has players.
- Brrl%: Baseball Savant fetch timed out or returned empty. Cached in KV for 6h — bust cache with `?bust=1`.
- After a cache bust: if `buildLineupKPct` or `buildPitcherKPct` hits an early-return (no games scheduled or all IDs empty), all destructured fields must be present in the return value — otherwise `lineupSpotByName` and `pitcherAvgPitches` come back `undefined`, causing `—` for every row. The early-return and catch blocks in `api/lib/mlb.js` include the full field set: `lineupSpotByName`, `lineupBatterKPctsOrdered`, etc. for lineup; `pitcherAvgPitches`, `pitcherEra`, `pitcherCSWPct` for pitchers.

### "P/GS all dashes"
Comes from gamelog starts-only (2026 primary) or season aggregate fallback `numberOfPitches / gamesStarted`. If a pitcher has 0 starts recorded yet in either source, will show `—`. Also check that `buildPitcherKPct` didn't hit the early-return path (see above).

### "P/GS shows wrong value for a confirmed starter (non-doubleheader)"
Two bugs can cause this:

**Bug A — stale KV cache with wrong probable:** The `byteam:mlb` KV cache (600s TTL) was built when a different pitcher was listed as the team's probable. The old `_pt()` team key lookup returned that wrong pitcher's avgPitches.

**Bug B — in-progress game poisons the average (UTC vs local date mismatch):** The pitcher has a game today (local date e.g. "2026-04-15") but the server's UTC clock already reads the next day ("2026-04-16"). The `_todayStr` filter (`new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)`) = "2026-04-16", so "2026-04-15" != "2026-04-16" passes the filter. If the game is in progress at cache-build time (e.g. NP=2 after first pitch), the tiny partial NP poisons the average: `(91+83+92+2)/4 = 67` instead of 88.7.

**Fixes:**
- `mlb.js` `startSplits` filter now requires `(s.stat?.numberOfPitches || 0) >= 30` — catches in-progress games that slip through the date filter due to UTC/local mismatch. A legitimate start always has 30+ pitches.
- `_avgP` IIFE in `[...path].js` (strikeouts block) uses a priority chain:
  1. **Name-based** (`_ps?.avgPitches` from `pitcherStatsByName`) — correct when pitcher is in probables
  2. **ESPN gamelog starts-only** — `IP >= 3` as start proxy; pitcher-specific; ESPN uses column `"P"` (not `"PC"`) for pitches, code tries both labels
  3. **Team key fallback** — last resort; may return wrong pitcher if cache is stale

`_avgP` is hoisted (`let _avgP = null`) at the outer per-market declarations so all 4 output sites use it.

### "Wrong pitcher stats for a team on a doubleheader day"
When a team plays two games (e.g. a makeup game + a regular game), the schedule loop processes both games and `pitcherByTeam["SD"]` ends up pointing to whichever pitcher was processed last — not necessarily tonight's Kalshi pitcher.

**Different-opponent doubleheader** (e.g. SD vs OAK + SD vs SEA): matchup keys `"SD|OAK"` and `"SD|SEA"` are distinct — the `_pt()` helper tries `team|opp` first and gets the right pitcher.

**Same-opponent doubleheader** (e.g. SD vs SEA twice): both games share the same matchup key `"SD|SEA"`. The second game overwrites `pitcherByTeam["SD"]` AND `pitcherByTeam["SD|SEA"]`, and drops the first pitcher's ID from `allIds` entirely — so their stats are never fetched.

Fix (in place): `allScheduledPitcherIds` (a `Set`) collects ALL pitcher IDs encountered in the schedule loop, regardless of overwrite. `allIds` is built from this set so every pitcher's season stats and gamelog are always fetched. `pitcherAvgPitchesById` stores avg pitches per MLB ID (not just per abbr). `cswByMlbId` is declared outside the CSW% try block. `pitcherStatsByName` has a fallback path for IDs in `allScheduledPitcherIds` that have no abbr in `pitcherByTeam` — it computes K%, KBB%, ERA, CSW%, avgPitches, gs26, hasAnchor directly from the raw ID-keyed data.

### "API returning 504 / function stopped after 25s"
The CSW% play-by-play fetch in `buildPitcherKPct` fires one MLB Stats API request per game per pitcher. With 10–15 pitchers × multiple starts, this can exceed the 25s Vercel Edge limit. Mitigations in place: PBP limited to last 5 starts per pitcher; 8s AbortController aborts the whole PBP block and falls back to K% if slow. If 504s recur, check whether the PBP block is the bottleneck or if another fetch is slow.

### Cache busting
- `?bust=1` deletes `byteam:mlb` and forces a fresh MLB data rebuild
- `mlb:barrelPct` is NOT deleted on bust — barrel% survives busts with its own 6h TTL
- If bust fires before lineups/probables are available, `byteam:mlb` is written with 60s TTL so next request retries
- Depth chart: no bust — expires daily

### "NBA report shows — for Pace/AvgMin/Rest on most rows"
Most NBA markets are dropped at `opp_not_soft` before the pre-sim block runs. Those drop records include `isB2B`, `nbaPaceAdj`, and `nbaOpportunity` computed inline from the gamelog at that drop site. `nbaPreSimScore` and `nbaSimScore` are also computed inline at the drop site so the Score column is populated for all NBA rows (not just qualifying plays).

### "SimScore shows yellow for strikeout players with score 7–9"
The qualifying gate for strikeouts is `finalSimScore >= 11` (Alpha tier). The report SimScore column uses `>= 10` as the yellow threshold, so scores 10 show yellow (near miss) and scores 7–9 show gray.
