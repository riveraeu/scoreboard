# Scoreboard — Project Guide for Claude

## What This Is
A sports prop betting dashboard that pulls Kalshi prediction market prices, computes a model True%, and shows qualified plays with an edge over the market. Deployed on Vercel Edge (no Node.js APIs — Web Fetch/KV only).

**Production URL**: `https://scoreboard-ivory-xi.vercel.app`

## Architecture

### API: `api/[...path].js` + `api/lib/`
`api/[...path].js` handles all server logic as a Vercel Edge Function. It imports from four ES module lib files:
- `api/lib/simulate.js` — park factor constants + all simulation functions (log5K, simulateKsDist, buildNbaStatDist, simulateHits, kelly/EV math)
- `api/lib/mlb.js` — MLB data fetchers (buildLineupKPct, buildBarrelPct, buildPitcherKPct) + MLB_ID_TO_ABBR
- `api/lib/nba.js` — NBA/DVP data fetchers (buildNbaDvpStage1/FromBettingPros/Stage3FG, buildNbaDepthChartPos, buildNbaPaceData, buildNbaPlayerPosFromSleeper, warmPlayerInfoCache)
- `api/lib/utils.js` — response helpers (corsHeaders, jsonResponse, errorResponse), ALLOWED_ORIGIN, team ranking helpers (buildSoftTeamAbbrs, buildHardTeamAbbrs, buildTeamRankMap, parseGameOdds, SOFT_TEAM_METRIC)

Routes via `pathname`:
- `/api/tonight` — main play generation endpoint
- `/api/tonight?debug=1` — returns all markets including dropped/preDropped + debug fields
- `/api/tonight?bust=1` — bypasses KV cache
- `/api/kalshi` — raw Kalshi market data
- `/api/player` — ESPN player info + gamelog
- `/api/dvp` — Defense vs Position data
- `/api/nba-depth` — NBA depth chart from ESPN
- `/api/keepalive` — cron ping (daily)
- `/api/dvp/debug-dc` — inspect depth chart cache

### Frontend: `index.html`
Single HTML file with JSX compiled via Babel standalone (no build step). All React components inline.

### Storage: Cloudflare KV (`CACHE2`)
Used for caching expensive fetches. Key TTLs:
- `byteam:mlb` — 600s (MLB team stats, probables, lineup K-rates). **Does NOT include `barrelPctMap`** — that lives in `mlb:barrelPct`. Uses 60s TTL if lineupSpotByName or pitcherAvgPitches come back empty (e.g. bust before lineups confirmed), so next request retries quickly.
- `byteam:nba` — 1800s
- `byteam:nfl` — 1800s
- `gameTimes:v2:{date}` — 600s
- `nbaStatus:{date}` — 600s
- `nba:pace:2526` — 43200s (12h, fetched via ESPN `sports.core.api.espn.com` team stats, `buildNbaPaceData()`)
- `mlb:barrelPct` — 21600s (6h, Baseball Savant barrel%)
- `nba:depth:{date}` — daily

## Sports & Stats

### MLB
- **Stats**: `hits`, `hrr` (H+R+RBI), `strikeouts`
- **Kalshi series**: `KXMLBHITS`, `KXMLBHRR`, `KXMLBKS`
- **Data sources**: MLB Stats API (schedule, lineups, probables, pitcher gamelogs), ESPN gamelogs, Baseball Savant (barrel%)

#### MLB Strikeouts Model
True% = Monte Carlo simulation (`simulateKsDist` + `kDistPct`)
- Shared distribution per pitcher (keyed `playerTeam|pitcherHand`) — guarantees P(K≥4) ≥ P(K≥5)
- `pitcherKDistCache` built before play loop
- 10000 sims if `simScore ≥ 11`, else 5000
- **SimScore** (max 11 pre-edge, 14 with edge bonus):
  - CSW% > 30% → 3pts (falls back to K% > 24%)
  - K-BB% > 15% → 2pts
  - Lineup oK% > 24% → 3pts (hand-adjusted vs RHP/LHP)
  - Avg pitches/start > 85 → 2pts
  - Park factor > 1.0 → 1pt
  - Edge > 5% → 3pts (bonus, added after simulation)
- **Gates**: simScore ≥ 7 to enter play loop; finalSimScore ≥ 10 to qualify as a play (7–9 = qualified:false, shows in report but not plays card)
- Pitchers fetched via `buildPitcherKPct(mlbSched)` — avg pitches per start from season aggregate `numberOfPitches / gamesStarted`
- **K% regression**: `trust = min(1.0, bf26 / 200)` — uses 2026 BF only (NOT combined 2026+2025). Full trust at ~33 starts. Blends 2026 actual K% with 2025 anchor (or league avg 22.2% if no 2025 data). KBB% regressed the same way.
- Park factors in `PARK_KFACTOR` map

#### MLB Hitters (hits/hrr) Model
True% = Monte Carlo simulation (`simulateHits`) using batter BA × pitcher BAA (log5)
- **SimScore** (max 11 pre-edge, 14 with edge bonus):
  - Lineup spot 1–2 → 3pts, spot 3–4 → 2pts
  - Pitcher WHIP > 1.35 → 3pts (from pitcher gamelog)
  - Pitcher FIP > ERA → 2pts
  - Park hit factor > 1.02 → 1pt
  - Edge > 5% → 3pts
- **Gates**: lineup spot 1–4 required; hitterSimScore ≥ 7; BA ≥ .270 (good/elite tier only); edge ≥ 3%
- Barrel% from Baseball Savant (`buildBarrelPct`) — cached 6h in KV

### NBA
- **Stats**: `points`, `rebounds`, `assists`, `threePointers`
- **Kalshi series**: various per stat
- True% = Monte Carlo simulation (`buildNbaStatDist` + `nbaDistPct`) — normal distribution over per-game values
  - `nbaPlayerDistCache` keyed `playerId|stat` — all thresholds (3+, 4+, 5+) share one distribution, guaranteeing monotonicity
  - Mean from last 10 games (recency), std from full season (stability)
  - Adjusted mean: `× teamDefFactor × (1 + paceAdj×0.002) × 0.93 if B2B`
  - `teamDefFactor` = general team defense (`rankMap[opp].value / leagueAvg`) — NOT position-adjusted DVP
  - Falls back to avg(seasonPct, softPct) − 4% if B2B when simulation returns null (<5 game values)
- **SimScore** (max 11 pre-edge, 14 with edge bonus):
  - Pace (avg game pace above league avg) → 3pts — fetched from ESPN via `buildNbaPaceData()`, cached 12h
  - Avg minutes ≥ 30 (last 10 games) → 4pts; ≥ 25 → 2pts
  - Position-adjusted DVP rank ≤ 10 → 2pts
  - Not B2B → 2pts
  - Edge > 5% → 3pts (added after simulation)
- nSim scales with pre-edge simScore: ≥8 → 10k, ≥5 → 5k, else 2k
- **Gate**: opp in soft DVP teams; edge ≥ 3%
- Avg minutes from ESPN gamelog `MIN` column (last 10 games), no external API needed
- Depth chart position via `nbaDepthChartPos` (ESPN depth chart API, cached daily)

### NHL
- **Stats**: `goals`, `assists`, `points`
- True% = avg(seasonPct, dvpAdjustedPct, vSoftPct) with B2B -4%, DVP adjustment × 1.06
- Gate: opp in soft GAA teams; edge ≥ 3%

### NFL
- **Stats**: `passingYards`, `rushingYards`, `receivingYards`, `receptions`, `completions`, `attempts`
- Gate: opp in soft teams; edge ≥ 3%

### Kalshi Market Parsing
- Series tickers in `SERIES_CONFIG`
- Filter: `pct >= 70` AND `pct <= 97`
- Blended fill price via orderbook walk for thin markets

### preDropped vs dropped
- `preDropped`: filtered before main play loop (no ESPN info yet) — included in `?debug=1` response
- `dropped`: filtered inside play loop — included in `?debug=1` response

### qualified:false plays
MLB strikeout markets that fail simScore gate (< 7 or finalSimScore < 10) are pushed to `plays[]` with `qualified: false` so the player card can show real simPct for all thresholds. The main plays list (`tonightPlays`) filters these out client-side: `.filter(p => p.qualified !== false)`.

The raw (unfiltered) array is stored in `allTonightPlays` and used to build `tonightPlayerMap` in the player card — this ensures `qualified: false` thresholds (e.g. 3+/4+ strikeouts with no edge bonus) get their simulation-based truePct rather than falling back to the raw formula.

---

## Frontend Architecture (`index.html`)

### State
- `tonightPlays` — qualified plays from `/api/tonight`, filtered `qualified !== false`
- `allTonightPlays` — raw (unfiltered) plays array from `/api/tonight`, includes `qualified: false` entries; used exclusively for building `tonightPlayerMap` in the player card so all strikeout thresholds get their simulation-based truePct instead of falling back to the raw formula
- `reportData` — full debug response from `/api/tonight?debug=1`, shown in Market Report overlay
- `player` — currently selected player for detail card
- `trackedPlays` — user's saved picks (localStorage or server)

### Market Report
Opened via "report" button. Shows ALL markets (plays + dropped) grouped by sport/stat. Columns vary by sport/stat via `XCOLS` map.
- **HRR table**: shows threshold=1 rows only (2+/3+/etc. filtered client-side — too noisy)
- **Score > 10 highlight**: For MLB rows (strikeouts + HRR), the player name is white+bold only when `finalSimScore ?? hitterFinalSimScore > 10` (Alpha tier). Rows with score ≤ 10 get a dim gray name even if qualified. Non-MLB tables use the original `m.qualified` logic for name color.

### Play Cards
Shows `untrackedPlays` (qualified plays not yet tracked). Each card has:
- True% bar (color = tierColor, odds = model-implied from truePct)
- Kalshi% bar (purple, odds = Kalshi americanOdds)
- Explanation card (varies by sport/stat)
- SimScore gate breakdown

### Player Card
Clicking a play opens the player card with:
- Historical rates per threshold
- Kalshi market prices
- truePct from `tonightPlayerMap` (keyed `stat|threshold`) — built from `allTonightPlays` (unfiltered) so `qualified: false` thresholds (e.g. 3+/4+ strikeouts with no edge bonus) use their simulation-based truePct
- Monotonicity enforced client-side: after building `_rawTruePctMap`, walks highest→lowest threshold tracking the running max and raises any value that dips below it. Safety net for any remaining non-monotonicity after backend sweep.

**Root cause of non-monotonic truePcts for strikeouts (fixed at backend):**
The deduplication step (`bestMap` keyed by `playerName|sport|stat`) collapsed all strikeout thresholds for a pitcher to the single highest-edge play (e.g. only 5+ survived). 3+ and 4+ were absent from `allTonightPlays`, so the player card used the fallback formula — giving values below the simulation's 5+ truePct, breaking monotonicity.

Fix: `qualified:false` plays use a threshold-inclusive key (`playerName|sport|stat|threshold`) so all thresholds survive deduplication. The post-loop monotonicity sweep then re-derives truePct for every threshold from the `pitcherKDistCache` distribution (if available), giving distinct monotonically-decreasing values (e.g. 3+≈99.5%, 4+≈99.0%, 5+=98.1%). Falls back to copy-up sweep if cache is unavailable.

### Color Tiers
```
tierColor(pct): >= 80% → #3fb950 (green), >= 65% → #e3b341 (yellow), else #f78166 (red)
```

### NBA AvgMin Tiers (report column)
- ≥ 30 min → green (4 SimScore pts)
- ≥ 25 min → yellow (2 SimScore pts)
- < 25 min → red (0 pts)

## Deployment
- Platform: Vercel Edge Functions
- No build step — `index.html` served statically, `api/[...path].js` is the edge function
- Rewrites in `vercel.json`: `/api/:path*` → `/api/[...path]`
- CORS headers set in `vercel.json` (required for OPTIONS preflight through rewrite layer)
- Cron: `/api/keepalive` runs daily at noon UTC

---

## Testing

Unit tests cover simulation math and the player card truePct fix:
```
# Preferred — no Node required, uses macOS built-in JavaScriptCore:
osascript -l JavaScript api/lib/simulate.test.jxa.js

# If Node is installed:
node --test api/lib/simulate.test.js
```
Two test files kept in sync:
- `api/lib/simulate.test.jxa.js` — self-contained, runs via `osascript -l JavaScript` (no Node needed). Primary test runner.
- `api/lib/simulate.test.js` — Node `node:test` version (requires Node).

Both cover: `kDistPct` monotonicity, `simulateKsDist` validity, `buildNbaStatDist`, API monotonicity sweep, `allTonightPlays` player card fix, frontend `_rawTruePctMap` monotonicity enforcement, NBA simScore, and report filter logic.

## Common Debugging

### "Why is truePct wrong for 3+/4+ when 5+ looks correct?" (fixed)
Previously, `tonightPlayerMap` was built from `tonightPlays` (filtered: `qualified !== false`). Thresholds like 3+/4+ with no edge bonus (finalSimScore < 10) were `qualified: false` and omitted, so the player card used the raw fallback formula `(seasonPct + softPct) / 2` — breaking monotonicity (e.g. 4+ showed 76.8% while 5+ showed 97.9%).

**Fix**: `tonightPlayerMap` now uses `allTonightPlays` (unfiltered), which includes `qualified: false` entries with their API-computed, monotonicity-enforced simulation truePct.

If truePct still looks wrong: check `?debug=1` and look in `dropped` for the missing threshold — if it's there (not in `plays[]` at all), the fallback still applies. Check `reason`.

### "Why is truePct the same for 4+ and 5+?"
The `pitcherKDistCache` shares one `Int16Array` distribution across all thresholds for a pitcher — querying it at different thresholds guarantees P(K≥4) ≥ P(K≥5) by construction. If values are identical, it likely means the distribution is flat at that range (e.g. a dominant pitcher where nearly all sims exceed both thresholds).

### "Player appears in Kalshi but not in plays or dropped"
Check `preDropped` in `?debug=1` response. Common reasons: `no_soft_data`, `opp_not_soft`, `no_opp`.

Also check the date filter: the edge function runs UTC, so after midnight UTC (e.g. 8pm ET = midnight UTC), `gameDate:"2026-04-13"` is filtered if the server sees the next day. The cutoff is `Date.now() - 86400000` (yesterday) to handle this — but if a play was on a date 2+ days ago, it will still be filtered.

### "Market report shows — for Spot/Brrl%"
- Spot: lineup not confirmed yet (pre-game). Projected lineups from last 7 days are used as fallback.
- Brrl%: Baseball Savant fetch timed out or returned empty. Cached in KV for 6h — bust cache with `?bust=1`.
- After a cache bust: if `buildLineupKPct` or `buildPitcherKPct` hits an early-return (no games scheduled or all IDs empty), all destructured fields must be present in the return value — otherwise `lineupSpotByName` and `pitcherAvgPitches` come back `undefined`, causing `—` for every row. The early-return and catch blocks in `api/lib/mlb.js` include the full field set: `lineupSpotByName`, `lineupBatterKPctsOrdered`, etc. for lineup; `pitcherAvgPitches`, `pitcherEra`, `pitcherCSWPct` for pitchers.

### "P/GS all dashes"
Comes from `split.numberOfPitches / split.gamesStarted` in season aggregate stats. If a pitcher has 0 starts recorded yet, will show `—`. Also check that `buildPitcherKPct` didn't hit the early-return path (see above).

### Cache busting
- `?bust=1` deletes `byteam:mlb` and forces a fresh MLB data rebuild
- `mlb:barrelPct` is NOT deleted on bust — barrel% survives busts with its own 6h TTL
- If bust fires before lineups/probables are available, `byteam:mlb` is written with 60s TTL so next request retries
- Depth chart: no bust — expires daily

### "NBA report shows — for Pace/AvgMin/Rest on most rows"
Most NBA markets are dropped at `opp_not_soft` before the pre-sim block runs. Those drop records include `isB2B`, `nbaPaceAdj`, and `nbaOpportunity` computed inline from the gamelog at that drop site. `nbaPreSimScore` and `nbaSimScore` are also computed inline at the drop site so the Score column is populated for all NBA rows (not just qualifying plays).

### "SimScore shows yellow for strikeout players with score 7–9"
The qualifying gate for strikeouts is `finalSimScore >= 10`. The report SimScore column uses `>= 10` as the yellow threshold when `finalSimScore` is present, so scores 7–9 show gray (not qualifying).
